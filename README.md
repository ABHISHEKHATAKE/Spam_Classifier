# ðŸ“§ Spam Classifier using Deep Learning and NLP

This project implements a spam detection system using **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It classifies SMS or email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** by learning patterns in text using neural networks such as LSTM or GRU. The goal is to build an intelligent text classifier with high accuracy and real-time prediction capability.
