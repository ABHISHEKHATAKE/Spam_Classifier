# Spam_Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based text classification system designed to detect whether a message (email or SMS) is spam or not spam. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess raw text and uses neural networks to learn patterns that distinguish spam from legitimate messages.
